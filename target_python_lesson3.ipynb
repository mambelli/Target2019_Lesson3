    "# Target Python Lesson - Part 3\n",
    "###### By: Thomas Hein, Marco Mambelli\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial includes a brief explanation of what a class is an how you  can use it.\n",
    "Object Oriented programming and Classes are commonly refereed to as an advanced topic and the subject of complete courses like [OOP on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-intermediate-python-3/modules/int-python-object-oriented-programming) or on [OOP in Python on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crash-course-object-oriented-programming-in-python/) or [Week 8 of Harward's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/8/).\n",
    "This introduction is by no mean exhaustive or a replacement of the above courses, but will allow you to undestand the basics of this Python capability.\n",
    "It may seem a little confusing at first but it's not complicated. Read each section step by step, that's kind of important if you're new to them.\n",

    "# 1: Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1: What is Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods (functions operating on the object), accessed via dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah, I'm sure you now know what a class is now, Part 3.1 done...\n",
    "\n",
    "Put aside the definition above, read this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A class contains functions (called methods) and variables (called data attributes) as one big bundle.\n",
    "1. You can have some methods that can be invoked outside of the class definition (public) and some that you can access only internally within the code of the class (private).\n",
    "1. Same with data attributes, some can be used outside the class (public attributes) and some only within the class (private attributes).\n",
    "1. The class is like a mold to create many variables (called objects), via instantiation `myvar = MyClassName()`. All objects have the same attributes and methods defined in the class, referred using dot notation (`myvar.attribute_name`, `myvar.method_name()`).   \n",
    "1. When defining methods (aka. functions), add the variable `self` as the first parameter e.g. `def addNumbers(self, num1, num2):`. This will be the object itself.\n",
    "1. When calling methods, e.g. `my_object.addNumbers(1,2)` Python will add the `self` parameter automatically using the object.\n",
    "1. Within each method of the class, you can refer the class's variables by using `self.variable_name_goes_here` and methods by using `self.function_name_goes_here()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last three lines refer to regular methods, aka instance methods. There are also special methods, static or class methods that behave differently. If you want to learn more about static and class methods, you can read [here](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/) or [this reference documentation](https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/functions/staticmethod.html), but first complete this section."

For example, when it see's the start of an `a` tag, we need to see if its an `a` tag and count how many times that happens.
