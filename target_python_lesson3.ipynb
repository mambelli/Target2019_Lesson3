   "source": "# Target Python Lesson - Part 3\n###### By: Thomas Hein, Marco Mambelli\n---\n\nThis tutorial will explain what a class is and how to use it. Classes are commonly refereed to as an advanced topic. It may seem a little confusing at first but it's not complicated. Read each section step by step, that's kind of important if you're new to them.\n\n\n# 1: Object Oriented Programming\n\n### 1.1: What is Class?\n\n> A prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods (functions operating on the object), accessed via dot notation.\n\nAh, I'm sure you now know what a class is now, Part 3.1 done...\n\nPut aside the definition above, read this:\n\n1. A class contains functions (called methods) and variables (called data attributes) as one big bundle.\n1. You can have some methods that can be invoked outside of the class definition (public) and some that you can access only internally within the code of the class (private).\n1. Same with data attributes, some can be used outside the class (public variables) and some only within the class (private variables).\n1. The class is like a mold to create many variables (called objects), via instantiation `myvar = MyClassName()`. All objects have the same attributes and methods defined in the class, referred using dot notation (`myvar.attribute_name`, `myvar.method_name()`).   \n1. When defining methods (aka. functions), add the variable `self` as the first parameter e.g. `def addNumbers(self, num1, num2):`. This will be the object itself.\n1. When calling methods, e.g. `my_object.addNumbers(1,2)` Python will add the `self` parameter automatically using the object.\n1. Within each method of the class, you can refer the class's variables by using `self.variable_name_goes_here` and methods by using `self.function_name_goes_here()`.\n\nThe last three lines refer to regular methods, aka instance methods. There are also special methods, static or class methods that behave differently. If you want to learn more about static and class methods, you can read [here](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/) or [this reference documentation](https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/functions/staticmethod.html), but first complete this section."

Let's get our data in a way that Python can more easily understand it.\n\nFrom the Python documentation,\n\n> Bytes literals are always prefixed with 'b' or 'B'; they produce an instance of the bytes type instead of the str type.

Let's create a new class based off of the HTMLParser class.\n\nCreate a new class based off of the HTMLParser class? Is that even possible? Yes! It's called class inheritence. Right now there is an HTMLParser class. It can parse HTML, and that's about it. We need it to perform some actions while its parsing the HTML, which it currently is **not** set to do. For example, when it see's the start of an `a` tag, we need to see if its an `a` tag and count how many times that happens. What we can do is create a new class and import another class while creating the new class. What will happen is, that class will have everything the other class has, and we can add onto that class or redefine some variables/methods it has.\n\nSo, let's create a new class called `MyHTMLParser` and in the paramters of the class, pass the inherited class `HTMLParser`. Next, we can take a method of the `HTMLParser` class called `handle_starttag()` and redefine it here. When the class looks for a `handle_starttag()` method, it'll now use the method we defined instead of using it's old method it had."

Below we're going to go over a few simple examples of how one would go about plotting in 3D.\n\nFirst, we need to import Matplotlib. We also have to import a library that will provide 3D support for Matplotlib. Then, we'll create a figure and add a plot that is a 3D image (`projection='3d'`).
