You may not import any modules.\n\n### Hints\n\n- Look how to take strings and splice them\n\n### Solution\n\nWrite below your solution.\nHere an example of how objects of the class could work.\n\n```\nmy_object = roman()\n\nprint(my_object.int2roman(7))\nVII\n\nprint(my_object.roman2int(IX))\n9\n```"

Look specifically in the `<p></p>` tag and count the words in there. A word is any text/numbers/whatever is separated by a space, so the text, \"`Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays`\" there are 7 words.\n\n### Hints\n\n- Use the `http.client` module to get the web page\n- Remember to convert to UTF-8\n- Use the parser if you want to get all the paragraph tags\n\n### Solution\n\nWrite below your solution."
